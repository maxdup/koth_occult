# Koth Occult

A custom map for Team Fortress 2

## The project folder "content\maps"
- **koth_occult_rc6.vmf** is used for compiling the level.
- **koth_occult.vmm** is used for editing the level.

#### The asset folder "tf/"
All the asset dependencies (models, textures, etc...) are included in the tf folder.

## Compiling
The recommended parameters for vrad.exe are: -both -final -StaticPropLighting -StaticPropPolys -TextureShadows

## Branching
I ask that offshoot maps created from these files don't use any of these naming schemes:
"koth_occult_rc*", "koth_occult_final*" or simply "koth_occult".
